# CSE42ArduinoBot (2018 Fall)
700 lines of code finished in 5 hours before due lol

# Features
The code is basically a state machine (I wish I knew what FSM was lol). 
There are several state that makes this bot do all kinds of weird moves.
I even wrote a Java program to convert some MIDI file to c++ code that can embed in the text section so the bot can play I-don't-remember-what song I embed lol.

# Notes (Archived on 6/6/2020)
I wish I still have the video of the bot on the showcase day. It was so noisy that my bot's beautiful MIDI player is just completely useless, nobody could hear a thing in the room because everyone was trying to make some siren noises with their bots. I'm still amazed that I knew nothing about c++ but still able to bs that 700 lines in 5 hours before due #DueDrivenProgramming
